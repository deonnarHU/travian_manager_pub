---------------------------------------------------------
Later releases:

Errors found:
- found an error where in the buildings menu the "sort to plan" deletes entries - need to check further
- found a bug where trade routes are improperly processed if the frequency is under 1 hour


Improvements still needed:
- add a delete village template button
- set the resource field type distribution on the right side from the parsed res field data
- add an "inactive wh/granary fill time" table. Inactive means no new queues or parties, dont count those in, but calculate with trade routes and troops present
- add a "troops in villages" page parser, calculate crop consumption per villa from that - !!!IMPORTANT!!! - multi tribe troops (+ animals) are possible, that could break shit
- add a "time until accountwide negative crop" calculation from current net production + queues
- add an option to select hero items to adjust troop production time - queue cost
